                There's another requirement that needs to be fulfilled though.
                Out of those 25 pieces, you’ve been told that 16 don’t have 
                any restrictive relationship with their neighbors. Their 
                neighbors could be white or green. However, for the other 9, 
                the relationship with their neighbors should be as follows;

                Think of the value at the center as representing whether the 
                piece itself is green or white. 1 represents green, while 0 
                represents white. This is what this means for the first piece;
