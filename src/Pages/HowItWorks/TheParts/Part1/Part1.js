                I am working on a one-shot image recognition algorithm 
                that I am planning to use for medical diagnosis. It will possibly be used 
                in a lot of other places though. Right now I am 
                at the prototype stage. I'll be deploying the algorithm through an 
                API so people can interract with it using this 
                interface. If you are interested in how it works, feel free to read along;

                Think of it like a jig-saw puzzle. Try to solve the following
                puzzle and once done, click on the <span className="see-solution-span">next </span>
                link to see the solution plus a further discussion of the idea

                        You have 25 differently colored pieces that you need to put 
                        together to create a whole image (just like a normal 
                        jigsaw puzzle). Four of the pieces are colored green, while 
                        21 are white. You have been told to get the pieces together 
                        to create an image whose dimensions are 5 by 5
